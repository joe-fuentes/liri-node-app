/*
    Initialize a package.json file at your project root. Be sure to save all of the npm packages you'll be using to this file. If you fail to initialize a package.json file and save your dependencies to it, it will be troublesome, and at times almost impossible for anyone else to run your code.

    Do Not add this file to the .gitignore. This would be a good thing to do in the real world, but it makes grading this assignment a challenge.
